## About

I am Alexander McIntosh, a data scientist with a focus on fair, explainable
machine learning models and artificially intelligent systems.
I have become ensnared by the concept of learning, by both humans and machines,
and the symbiotic growth that emerges from their intersection.
I love to compose music, play guitar, and develop video games in my free time.

## Professional

I am currently employed by Optum as a Technology Development Program Associate.
I have been responsible for engineering a large language model system to
perform automated statistical analysis.
I have been extremely fortunate to find myself in a position that pursues the
cutting edge of the possible.
